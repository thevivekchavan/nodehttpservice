Node http service
Run a HTTP node service which accepts http requests

1. Install Nodejs
2. Install npm modules in the dir using npm install (make sure you have the package.json file)
3. Specify the port number on which you want to start the http service in the js file.
4. Copy your website you want to 'public' folder.
5. Run the service using command "node <file_name>.js"
6. You can now browse the website locally on "http://127.0.0.1:<port>" (Eg: http://127.0.0.1:8080)

Shortcut: (Just run the 'start_http_service.bat' to do the above steps automatically)
